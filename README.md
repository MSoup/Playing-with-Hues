# Playing-with-Hues
A script that allows me to turn my Philips hues lightbulbs on and off with my computer. The purpose of the script is to get a handle on requests and web programming. More functionality to come as I get more curious.

## Instructions
First, read [this for reference](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/).
Use python 3 to run the python file.

Make sure to change the commented portion of my script to match your own.  

Lastly, enjoy the commands!
